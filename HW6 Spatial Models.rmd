## Input Packages and Data
```{r}
data(BCI)
BCI_xy = data.frame(x = rep(seq(625754, 626654, by = 100), each=5),y = rep(seq(1011569, 1011969, by=100), len=50))

```


## Question 1
Examine if there is evidence of spatial dependence in a rare and a common species in the BCI tree dataset.
```{r}



```

a. 


## Question 2
Build two generalized linear models to predict the abundance of the species Drypetes standleyi using the abundance of other tree species in the study site.
```{r}


```


1) Did including the spatial error term have a large impact on the coefficients of the model?
  a. 

2) Did including the spatial error terms significantly improve model fit?
  a. 

3) Explain why you did or did not observe a difference in the influence of adding the spatial error term between the two models.
  a.
